        <p>
          I've always had a passion for logic puzzles and alternate ways to solve problems. I started playing about with
          Python in 2020 (during the lockdowns) while working full time as a Class 1 HGV Driver and had that "this is
          it" moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to complete challenges on TryHackMe, learning the control and flow of using Linux (including booting
          an old laptop to Kali) and how computer networking works. After a few weeks of this, I realised my passion was
          more aligned to bringing applications to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the world started to return to normal and the presence of hybrid working became prominent, I decided
          that I needed to commit fully to a new career and start down the path of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the decision to enrol at the University of London on a BSc Computer Science degree, resulting in a
          first semester score of 96 (Intro to Programming), confirmation that I'd chosen the right path!
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that point, I have also completed a Software Engineering Bootcamp between Nov 22 and Feb 23, achieving a
          score of 100% overall.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently cementing my knowledge by building projects in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and getting
          familiar with frameworks such as Django.
